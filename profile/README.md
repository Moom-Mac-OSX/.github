## What is Moom Mac?  

**Moom for Mac** is an elegant and powerful **window management utility** that makes resizing, snapping, and arranging app windows effortless. Designed by **Many Tricks**, Moom enhances productivity by letting you move and organize windows with precision — either through your mouse or keyboard shortcuts.  

Instead of dragging and resizing windows manually, Moom allows users to quickly align them into custom layouts or predefined grid positions. The app adds a small green pop-up icon (next to the standard macOS zoom button) that provides easy access to window placement commands — such as left half, right half, top, bottom, fullscreen, or user-defined areas.  

Beyond basic resizing, **Moom** remembers preferred window arrangements, which is particularly helpful for those working with multiple displays or frequently switching between workspaces.  

Moom integrates seamlessly with macOS, offering intuitive behavior and smooth animations. It’s compatible with **macOS Monterey**, **Ventura**, and **Sonoma**, and optimized for **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)** Macs.
